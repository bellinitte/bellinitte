### About me

I tinker with parsers and compilers, do some web development, and sometimes dabble in gamedev. Currently I'm writing Rust code for [ANIXE](https://anixe.io/).

Lately, I've been contributing to the ecosystem of [Uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) &mdash; an 8-bit virtual computer by [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co). My main contribution is [Ruxnasm](https://github.com/karolbelina/ruxnasm) &mdash; an alternative to the standard assembler for Uxn, featuring sophisticated and user-friendly error reporting. I've also made several extensions for various text editors to support Uxn's assembly language.

In my free time, I'm toying around with electronics. Currently, I'm taming an ATmega328P to emulate [Varvara](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html) &mdash; a system built on top of Uxn that connects to various peripheral devices.
