### About me

I tinker with parsers and compilers, do some web development, and sometimes dabble in gamedev, graphic design, and typography. Currently I'm writing Rust code for [ANIXE](https://anixe.io/).

In my free time I toy around with my fantasy instruction set architecture called [Yot](https://github.com/yot-isa). Presently, the bytecode is being emulated on a [virtual machine](https://github.com/yot-isa/yvm), however, I'm also planning to implement a Yot CPU as an actual electronic circuit on breadboards. I'm working on a full-fledged [assembler](https://github.com/yot-isa/ysm) in Rust, which compiles my custom assembly language to Yot bytecode.

I created [Parser-parser](https://github.com/karolbelina/parser-parser), which is a web-based tool for defining context-free grammars in Extended Backus-Naur form. The core logic is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly to be executed on the web.
