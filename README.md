### About me

I'm a computer science student who tinkers with parsers and compilers, does some web development, and in his free time dabbles in gamedev, graphic design, and typography.

Currently, I'm toying around with my fantasy instruction set architecture called [Yot](https://github.com/yot-isa). Presently, the bytecode is being emulated on a [virtual machine](https://github.com/yot-isa/yvm), however, I'm also planning to implement a Yot CPU as an actual electronic circuit on breadboards. I'm working on a full-fledged [assembler](https://github.com/yot-isa/ysm) in Rust, which compiles my custom assembly language to Yot bytecode.

I created [Parser-parser](https://github.com/karolbelina/parser-parser), which is a web-based tool for defining context-free grammars in Extended Backus-Naur form. The core logic is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly to be executed on the web.
